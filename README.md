# Our Spaces

###What is this app?

Our Spaces is an iOS application that allows users to record locations on Vassar campus that they feel are significant to them. The app presents a Google Maps view, where users can submit their current location or scroll around the map to submit a different location on Vassar Campus. Our Spaces also uses Location Services so that the map moves dynamically with the student. When a user submits a location, the program associates a randomly generated ID with the user and the location, the userID, and the time submitted are saved on a server using Parse. Parse is closing in January 2017, so we are looking into other back-end APIs. This purpose of this app is to help a fellow Sociology student gathers data for her thesis - more info below. 


###How we will use the data?

The data of "emotional moments," collected via this application, with regard to the campus and the surrounding Poughkeepsie area will be used to construct one or many visualized pieces demonstrating shared spaces of importance and vulnerability. In discovering these common spaces, the hope is to learn more about how we as Vassar students can communicate and connect with each other. Both the negative and the positive importances we share and the spaces we share need to be better understood. This data is a portion of Sarah King's thesis project entitled: "The Climate of Vulnerable Spaces." All data is anonymous, no names or personal data will be relayed or incorporated into the project.

###The results:

After collecting all of the data, we found out that the most emotionally - charged space on campus was a given student's dorm room. Thus, the pins showed significant spaces all over campus - showing Vassar itself holds a special place in the students' hearts overall.

In May 2016, an exhibit was created to display these results and show the Vassar community what spaces they thought were significant.

###Who worked on this?

Kathryn Hodge:
For Vulnerable Spaces, I mainly worked on the front end. I helped configure the Google Maps View with the Server API key and worked on the code that allowed a user’s pins to be placed in their appropriate locations on the view. I also added UIAlertControllers to allow users to see that their location had been submitted as well as an undo button that not only removed the pin, but also the location from the database. The biggest programming challenge was probably messing around with auto-constraints to get the center pin, buttons, and placed pins exactly how we wanted. This project was so much fun and I can’t wait to create more with VC++!
